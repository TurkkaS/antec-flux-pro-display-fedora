![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Reikooters/antec-flux-pro-display)

A Linux application which will output your CPU and GPU temperature onto the [Antec Flux Pro](https://www.antec.com/product/case/flux-pro) case display.
This fork is for Fedora KDE (44). Upstream release didn't work with wrong libutils version so I compiled this.
I also automated most of the install process with a script. -TS

It uses the `sensors` rust crate, which uses `libsensors`, so works with any CPU or GPU, but you will need to do some manual installation steps described below.

This project builds upon [nishtahir/antec-flux-pro-display](https://github.com/nishtahir/antec-flux-pro-display) and [AKoskovich/antec_flux_pro_display_service](https://github.com/AKoskovich/antec_flux_pro_display_service). While maintaining the performance benefits of Rust from the first project, it improves temperature monitoring by allowing custom configuration of device and sensor names, rather than assuming fixed hardware monitor assignments. This ensures accurate temperature readings across different system configurations.

## Features

- Real-time CPU and GPU temperature monitoring
- Configurable sensor sources for maximum compatibility
- Systemd service for automatic startup
- Low resource usage through Rust implementation
- Easy configuration through a simple config file

## System Requirements

### Hardware

- Antec Flux Pro case with built-in display
- Case display plugged into USB port on motherboard

### Software

- Linux distribution with systemd (tested on Kernel 6.14.9)
- Required packages:

  | Distribution | Package Names |
  |-------------|---------------|
  | Debian/Ubuntu | `lm-sensors`, `usbutils` |
  | Arch Linux | `lm_sensors`, `usbutils` |
  | Fedora | `lm_sensors`, `lm_sensors-devel`, `libusb1-devel`, `usbutils`, `rust`, `cargo` |

> [!TIP]
> The `usbutils` package isn't technically required for the application to function, it's just used during the installation steps to give you the `lsusb` command, which is used to check to ensure the case display is correctly plugged into your motherboard and recognised.

### Dependencies

- `libsensors` (provided by Fedora's `lm_sensors` package)
- `lm_sensors-devel`, Rust, and Cargo when building from source
- Proper USB permissions (configured during installation)

## Fedora Linux Installation

This fork is maintained for Fedora Linux. Fedora provides `libsensors.so.4`, so the application should be built locally against Fedora's system libraries rather than using the precompiled upstream release binary.

### Automated installation

The included `install-fedora.sh` script installs the required Fedora packages, builds the application, creates `/etc/antec-flux-pro-display/config.conf`, installs the USB udev rule, and installs and enables the systemd service.

From the repository directory:

    chmod +x install-fedora.sh
    ./install-fedora.sh

### Manual installation

Install the required packages:

    sudo dnf install rust cargo lm_sensors lm_sensors-devel libusb1-devel usbutils

Build and install:

    cargo build --release
    sudo install -Dm755 target/release/antec-flux-pro-display /usr/bin/antec-flux-pro-display

Create the configuration directory:

    sudo mkdir -p /etc/antec-flux-pro-display

Configure `sudo nano /etc/antec-flux-pro-display/config.conf` according to the sensor names reported by `sensors`.

## Installation Instructions

> Fedora users: use the Fedora Linux Installation instructions above. Do not install the precompiled release binary on Fedora.

### 1. Set up permission to write to the display

1. Ensure the Antec Flux Pro case display is connected to your computer:

```shell
lsusb | grep "2022:0522"
```

Output should look something like the below. If there is no output, then the case display isn't connected or recognised.
```
Bus 001 Device 005: ID 2022:0522 Љ Љ
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't have the `lsusb` command available on your computer, install `usbutils` using your package manager, for example on Arch Linux use `sudo pacman -S usbutils` or on Debian/Ubuntu use `sudo apt install usbutils`.

2. Create a udev rules file to allow yourself permission to write to the display:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-antec-flux-pro-display.rules
```

In this file, copy and paste the following content:

```
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="2022", ATTR{idProduct}=="0522", MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess"
```

Press Ctrl+X to quit Nano, pressing Y to say Yes to saving the file, and press Enter when prompted for the path to write to.

3. You must **reboot your computer** for the permission change to take effect.

### 2. Configure sensors

1. Identify the names of the sensors for your CPU and GPU. To do this, first run the following command:

```shell
sensors
```

Output should look something like the below.

```
k10temp-pci-00c3
Adapter: PCI adapter
Tctl:         +39.1°C  

nvme-pci-0400
Adapter: PCI adapter
Composite:    +30.9°C  (low  =  -0.1°C, high = +85.8°C)
                       (crit = +87.8°C)
Sensor 1:     +30.9°C  (low  = -273.1°C, high = +65261.8°C)

r8169_0_1000:00-mdio-0
Adapter: MDIO adapter
temp1:        +37.0°C  (high = +120.0°C)

amdgpu-pci-0300
Adapter: PCI adapter
vddgfx:      228.00 mV 
fan1:           0 RPM  (min =    0 RPM, max = 3000 RPM)
edge:         +28.0°C  (crit = +110.0°C, hyst = -273.1°C)
                       (emerg = +115.0°C)
junction:     +30.0°C  (crit = +110.0°C, hyst = -273.1°C)
                       (emerg = +115.0°C)
mem:          +50.0°C  (crit = +108.0°C, hyst = -273.1°C)
                       (emerg = +113.0°C)
PPT:          15.00 W  (cap = 340.00 W)
pwm1:              0%
sclk:          24 MHz 
mclk:         456 MHz 
```

Take note of the device name (the part before `-pci` in each heading) as well as the sensor label (to the left of the temperature).

For my computer, my CPU device name is `k10temp` and sensor name is `Tctl`. For my GPU, the device name is `amdgpu` and sensor name is `edge`.

2. Create a configuration file to be used by the application.

```shell
sudo nano /etc/antec-flux-pro-display/config.conf
```

In this file, copy and paste the following content, substituting your device and sensor names as appropriate. Device and sensor names are not case sensitive and can be specified as lowercase.

```conf
# CPU device for temperature monitoring
cpu_device=k10temp
cpu_temp_type=tctl

# GPU device for temperature monitoring
gpu_device=amdgpu
gpu_temp_type=edge

# Update interval in milliseconds
update_interval=1000
```

Press Ctrl+X to quit Nano, pressing Y to say Yes to saving the file, and press Enter when prompted for the path to write to.

> [!NOTE]
> #### Note if you have two devices with the same name:
> 
> If you have two devices with the same name, for example if you have both an AMD GPU and an AMD CPU with integrated graphics enabled, you might have two devices both named `amdgpu`. This means you'll need to also add the device's VendorId and DeviceId to the configuration in order to more explicitly specify the device.

### 3. Download the application and install the service

1. Download the `antec-flux-pro-display` binary from [Releases](https://github.com/TurkkaS/antec-flux-pro-display-fedora/releases). Then use `install` to copy it to `/usr/bin/antec-flux-pro-display` and make the file executable. Example:

```shell
curl -L -o antec-flux-pro-display "https://github.com/TurkkaS/antec-flux-pro-display-fedora/releases/download/v1.2/antec-flux-pro-display"
sudo install antec-flux-pro-display /usr/bin/
```

2. Create a service file for the application:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/antec-flux-pro-display.service
```

In this file, copy and paste the following content:

```
[Unit]
Description=Antec Flux Pro Display Service
StartLimitIntervalSec=0

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/antec-flux-pro-display
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
ProtectSystem=strict
ProtectHome=true
PrivateTmp=true
NoNewPrivileges=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Press Ctrl+X to quit Nano, pressing Y to say Yes to saving the file, and press Enter when prompted for the path to write to.

3. Start the service and enable it to run at boot:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start antec-flux-pro-display
sudo systemctl enable antec-flux-pro-display
```

The display should now be working.

## Troubleshooting

### Display Not Updating

- Check if the service is running: `systemctl status antec-flux-pro-display`
- Check to ensure you created the file for the udev rule correctly (as per instructions). Remember that **a reboot is required** in order for the change to take effect.
- Check sensor availability: `sensors`. If your computer doesn't have this command avaiable, installed the `lm-sensors` package from your distribution's package manager.

### Wrong Temperature Readings

- Verify sensor names in config match output of the `sensors` command
- Ensure the correct sensor label is used (e.g., `Tctl` for AMD CPUs)
- See the notes in installation steps about specifying the VendorId and DeviceId if you have two devices with the same name, e.g. two `amdgpu`.

## Configuration

The configuration file `/etc/antec-flux-pro-display/config.conf` supports the following options:

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| cpu_device | CPU temperature device name | `k10temp` |
| cpu_temp_type | CPU temperature sensor label | `tctl` |
| cpu_vendor_id | **Optional**, use it in addition to the name if you have two devices with the same name | `1022` |
| cpu_device_id | **Optional**, use it in addition to the name if you have two devices with the same name | `14e3` |
| gpu_device | GPU temperature device name | `amdgpu` |
| gpu_temp_type | GPU temperature sensor label | `edge` |
| gpu_vendor_id | **Optional**, use it in addition to the name if you have two devices with the same name | `1002` |
| gpu_device_id | **Optional**, use it in addition to the name if you have two devices with the same name | `7550` |
| update_interval | Update frequency in milliseconds | `1000` |

### Service Won't Start

- Check logs: `journalctl -u antec-flux-pro-display -n 50 --no-pager`
- Verify config file syntax
- Ensure USB device is connected (as per instructions)
- Ensure you have **rebooted your computer** if you only just created the udev rules file.

## Uninstalling

To uninstall, stop and disable the service, then remove the files which you created during the installation steps.

```shell
sudo systemctl stop antec-flux-pro-display
sudo systemctl disable antec-flux-pro-display
